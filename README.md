# KM Tools
A set of tools for Sketchup to assist in production design.

## Installation
Simply add the plugin to your sketchup plugin directory, found typically under:

`Users/<yourname>/Library/Application Support/Sketchup <year>/SketchupPlugins`

Where `<yourname>` is your username and `<year>` is the version of Sketchup you have installed.

This plugin is in active development and has only been tested on a Mac. Use at your own discretion!

## History
###Version 1.2
    Updated License Information and cleaned up folder structure. Added to github.
###Version 1.1
    Bare bones of the plugin, added toolbar and menu functionality, cleaned up the code a
    bit. I'm still new to ruby and I have to figure out how this plugin will actually
    interact with the UI and the model. The goal is to create a tool that will allow the user
    to scale a selected object to specified absolute dimensions instead of scaling based on
    a relative percentage.
